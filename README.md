## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to tracking and sharing the progress and contributions of **Zcash Brasil**, a team funded by the [Zcash Comunity Grants](https://github.com/ZcashCommunityGrants/zcashcommunitygrants) to support and promote the growth of Zcash cryptocurrency in Brazil.

Here, we provide detailed monthly summaries of our activities, achievements, and milestones to maintain transparency and accountability while fostering collaboration with the Zcash community.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. To document the team's activities on a monthly basis.
2. To provide insights into the initiatives aimed at growing Zcash in Brazil.
3. To ensure transparency in how funding is utilized to achieve the team's objectives.
4. To foster collaboration and open communication with the Zcash ecosystem.

## Structure

Each month's report will be stored in a separate directory, following the format `YYYY-MM`.
