We are thrilled about our promising start to 2025 and have exciting news for the community. Our commitment to expanding Zcash in Brazil is stronger than ever.

- As a first step, we have developed an education framework (PPT + BRAND) aimed at onboarding new Zcashers. This initiative will provide training for new members interested in discussing Zcash and earning their first ZEC, project: Zcash Junior Brasil

- We will also be hosting our first stand in Brazil, featuring engaging art and giveaways, at a medium to a large event in Minas Gerais from February 26th to March 1st. We are proud to be sponsors and will have a stage where our team will discuss Zcash - Modular Carnival

- In exciting news, we have established our first fiat on-ramp in Brazil through the partnership of Zashi with Coinbase. We will be starting work on this soon to create a marketing campaign in Brazil.

- Additionally, we have applied to present at ZconVI on the topic of "Brazilian CBDC vs. Privacy Implications."

- Our developer, James, has delivered Testnet Zecfaucet to developers, is providing support, and is actively participating in various teams within the Zcash ecosystem. This is another step in our commitment to collaboration.

- In January, we reached out to several partners and held numerous meetings. We will begin planning in February.

- We also have some projects, such as "Write to Earn," among other initiatives, that are open issues and will be executed soon.

- Our design team has been doing a remarkable job, and we will share updates as soon as they go live.

- We are continuing with all translations, research, moderation, calls, articles, quizzes, and testing of new products related to Zcash. We have a strong presence on social media, ZecHub DAO, etc.

Brand kit 
We, the design team, have gathered and made available png, jpg and svg files of some of the most relevant logos to the Zcash ecosystem for use by us at Zcash Brasil, ZecHub, collaborators and new ambassadors. With this kit in a zip format, it makes life easier for those who need to develop promotional material. A few wallets are still missing, but the update is on going.

### James Katz dev Report

### Short version:
January was a productive month with several key improvements, including ZecFaucet fraud prevention, performance optimizations, testnet faucet deployment, and Dizzy bug fixes. Additionally, contributions to uzw-parser such as adding ZecWallet Lite style key derivation logic.

### Detailed version:

#### Technical Support & Community Engagement
- **ZeWIF Meeting Participation**
  - Attended the ZeWIF (Zcash Extensible Wallet Interchange Format) Zoom meeting and contributed to discussions regarding standardized wallet formats and interoperability.

- **ZecFaucet Usage Analysis**
  - To gather user feedback and understand faucet usage patterns, initiated a community poll on the Zcash Forum. This helped identify faucet usage and feature requests from the community.

- **Testnet Faucet Announcement**
  - Following the successful setup of a testnet faucet, announced its availability on the Zcash Forum, allowing developers and users to experiment with testnet ZEC.

#### ZecFaucet Enhancements
- **Fraud Prevention Measures**
  Due to an increasing number of fraudulent claims, ZecFaucet was temporarily taken offline. After implementing new security measures, it was reopened with the following restrictions:

  - Permanent bans for addresses that had claimed more than 100 times.
  - Temporary bans for addresses making more than 5 claims within a 24-hour period.
  - These changes significantly reduced automated and abusive claims.
- **Spam Mitigation**
  - ZecFaucet received a large number of small "donation" transactions, containing offensive messages. To mitigate this, a minimum transaction value filter was introduced, blocking spam transactions. Also, the donation section was changed from "Recent donations" to "Top donations", displaying only the largest donations to the faucet.

- **Performance Optimization**
  - ZecFaucet previously fetched and recalculated transaction sums on the fly, causing slow performance. To resolve this:
  - Moved all transaction data fetching logic to a database, significantly improving response times.
  - Eliminated redundant recalculations, making the site more efficient.
  
- **Usability & Security Enhancements**
  To improve user experience and system integrity:

  - Implemented a wallet duplication check, preventing users from claiming twice from the same wallet using Unified Addresses (UA) and Sapling addresses.
  - Introduced a cooldown period during which claims are temporarily paused to protect against excessive withdrawals and preserve the faucet balance.

#### Testnet Faucet Deployment
  - Set up a testnet ZecFaucet to provide a resource for developers testing Zcash applications.
  - Successfully launched a Zebra testnet full node and conducted TAZ mining to supply testnet funds.
  - Preliminary tests confirmed that Testnet ZecFaucet is functioning correctly.

#### Bug Fixes
- **Dizzy Minor Bug Fix**

  - Dizzy, which includes several mini-games, had a bug allowing users to win games they initiated.
  - The expected behavior is that only other users should be able to participate and claim the prize.
  - This bug was identified and corrected.

#### Ecosystem Contributions
- **uzw-parser Enhancement**
  - Contributed to the universal Zcash wallet parser (uzw-parser) by adding support for ZecWallet Lite key derivation.
  - This update improves wallet format compatibility and aligns with efforts by ZingoLabs, which received funding to develop a tool for recovering lost funds from various wallets.

#### Maintenance & Infrastructure
- **SSL Certificate Renewal**
  To ensure uninterrupted service, SSL certificates for the following sites were renewed:
  - [ZecFaucet](https://zecfaucet.com)
  - [ZcashMetro](https://zcashmetro.io)

#### Billing
Certain services depend on VPC hosting and other cloud resources. The following infrastructure is currently in use:

- **4 AWS Lightsail Instances** – Supporting various hosted services.
- **1 AWS EC2.medium Instance** – Exclusive for Dizzy bot.
- **OpenAI API Keys** – Used for ZecGPT Discord bot.
- All payments for these services are fully up to date, ensuring uninterrupted operation.
